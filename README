  This is a Max OS X Lion application whose eventual goal is to be a fully-
fledged screen-recording program. As of now, it only records video.

Todo:
    (general)
        optimize in any way possible
        refactor
        improve the UI
    (future)
        record a selected area of the screen, or float around it
        different formats
        webcam integration
        allow it to replace file
        make the screen id casting portable
        internationalization
        name of screen
    (far future)
        integration with docs, pics
    (after the end of the world future)
        Windows version
